# Company Database (SQL Learning Project)

## Overview
This project is designed to facilitate learning **SQL basics** through building and working with a **Company Database**. It covers fundamental SQL concepts like table creation, data types, relationships, primary and foreign keys, querying with SELECT, filtering data, using joins, aggregating results, and more. The provided SQL files guide through different stages of learning SQL and applying it to real-world business data.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to provide hands-on experience with SQL. By working with these SQL files, the following concepts are explored:
- Creation of tables and definition of data types.
- Understanding the definition and use of primary keys, foreign keys, and relationships between tables.
- Insertion, updating, and deletion of data.
- Writing SQL queries to retrieve data, filter results, and perform aggregations.
- Implementing complex queries using JOINs, GROUP BY, and subqueries.
